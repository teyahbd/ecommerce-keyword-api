This can also be done a step at a time, see the [documentation here](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) for examples. \n",

For example, you can select between the *skip-gram* or the *CBOW (continuous bag of words)* algorithms. While the many options are certainly worth playing with, for now we will keep it simple. The one optional parameter we will set is ```min_count```. This sets the frequency below which all less-frequent words be ignored. As our dataset is relatively small, we will set this at 1 so as many words as possible are included in our word embeddings."
