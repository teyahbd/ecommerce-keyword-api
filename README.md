# About This Repo

This API forms part of a group project completed on the Northcoders software development bootcamp. Santa's Little Helper is an app created in React Native which uses a Word2Vec machine learning model to help users find an ideal present. Please find the main app repo here for further details and our project page with an app demo can be found here.

This repo contains two sections:

1. Keyword api
2. Custom word vector training

# Getting Started

As mentioned, there are two uses for this repo - hosting a Word2Vec keyword API and training a custom set of word vectors. If you only wish to host the API, it is not necessary to train a custom model as our pre-trained word vectors are already included in this repo (`/model/ecommerce_vecs.txt`). If that's the case, <a href="#2.-hosting-a-keyword-recommendation-api">skip to the second part</a> of this section.

## Data

To train a set of custom eCommerce word vectors, we have used an online retail dataset from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) which can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/).
