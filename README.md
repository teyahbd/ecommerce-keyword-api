# Getting Started

As mentioned, there are two uses for this repo - hosting a Word2Vec keyword API and training a custom set of word vectors. If you only wish to host the API, it is not necessary to train a custom model as our pre-trained word vectors are already included in this repo (`/model/ecommerce_vecs.txt`). If that's the case, <a href="#2.-hosting-a-keyword-recommendation-api">skip to the second part</a> of this section.
